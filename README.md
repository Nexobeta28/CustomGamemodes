# CustomGamemodes
A plugin for SCP:SL that uses [EXILED](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED/tree/1.2.2). Add new gamemodes to the game.

## Usage
**Help:** ```customgamemodes help```

**Select gamemode:** ```customgamemodes [gamemode]```

## Gamemodes
**default:** Classic SCP:SL gamemode.

**deathmatch:** Everyone spawns as a Facility Guard at the entrance with a USP. Collect ammo from the dead bodies.

**teamconquer:** DClasses vs Scientifics vs Guards vs SCP-096. Each class has a unique inventory with a different gun and a guard keycard. Kill players from the other teams to recruit them in yours. When someone is killed by the SCP-096 will respawn as Zombie. Nobody can't escape the facility, the round ends when a team recruits the 100% of players. [FF = Disabled]
